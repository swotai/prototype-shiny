This is the repository for the LA Expo line project, Prototype City visualization codes.
There are two main parts.  The "City Distribution" set consists of codes for visualization of the employment and population distribution of the prototype city in form of a heat map.
The "Benefits" set contains code for visualization of marginal cost and benefit analysis for various scenarios.

The Benefits codes are also hosted in ShinyApps.io.  The dashboard can be accessed from [this link](https://kdt43.shinyapps.io/Benefits/).
